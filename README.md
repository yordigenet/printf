  This team project is part of the ALX Software engineering program and it all about writing our own. printf function.

  This project is all about collaboration (use git in a team setting), applying variadic functions in a wide range, use of arrays, function pointers and so on but most importantly managing a bunch of files and finding a smooth workflow.
